# Journal Project

Author: Karina Santos Felippe

### Exceeding Requirements
For this project I added a class with the constants for the program, like the menu options.
For the Program class:
- I included a block of code to prevent the user choosing an option that is not available in the menu.
- New menu options created will not impact the loop in main that iterates the user option from the menu because it's defined in the constants that the "Quit" option will be always the last one, and because the program is refererencing this parameter using the same rule.
